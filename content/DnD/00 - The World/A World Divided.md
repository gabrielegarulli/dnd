**Introduction:**

In the Forgotten Realms, a world rich with history, magic, and intrigue, a great conflict has arisen. This war is not merely a clash of armies, but a battle of ideologies, a struggle for power, and a test of the very fabric of reality. The number of factions involved is directly tied to the concept of the **Spheres of Power**, celestial entities that govern different aspects of the multiverse.
